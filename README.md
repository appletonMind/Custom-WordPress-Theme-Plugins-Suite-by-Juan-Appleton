# 🎨 WordPress Custom Theme & Plugin Suite - by Juan Appleton

Welcome to my personal web development project built with **WordPress from scratch** — every line of code and every pixel of design was handcrafted by me. This repository represents a complete WordPress ecosystem: a custom theme, advanced content structure, original design, and custom plugin functionality.

Here you can see the demo of the custom theme and plugin ▼
